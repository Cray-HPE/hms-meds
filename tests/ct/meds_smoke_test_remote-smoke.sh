#     DESCRIPTION       : Automated test for verifying basic MEDS
#                         infrastructure and installation on Cray
#                         Shasta systems.

#
#     SYNOPSIS
#       This is a smoke test for HMS MEDS that verifies that the
#       service is running as expected following an installation.
#
#     INPUT SPECIFICATIONS
#       Usage: meds_smoke_test
#
#       Arguments: None
#
#     OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS
#       Plaintext is printed to stdout and/or stderr. The script exits
#       with a status of '0' on success and '1' on failure.
#
#     DESIGN DESCRIPTION
#       This smoke test is based on the Shasta health check srv_check.sh
#       script in the CrayTest repository that verifies the basic health of
#       various microservices but instead focuses exclusively on MEDS.
#       It was implemented to run from the ct-pipelines container off
#       of the NCN of the system under test within the DST group's Continuous
#       Testing (CT) framework as part of the remote-smoke test suite.
#
#     SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
#       Must be executed from the ct-pipelines container on a remote host
#       (off of the NCNs of the test system) with the Continuous Test
#       infrastructure installed.
